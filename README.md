## About Lets
Lets is a framework that combines packages and frameworks that improve the dynamics of the different work patterns of each golang programmer with structural elegance and syntax friendliness.
We believe that to build great microservices you also need to put convenience first. By using the same core structure, it will be easier and faster to work on golang services.

With great research and in-depth knowledge, we present a complete framework with the following features:

- Saga (Orchestration & Choreograpy) with API-Driven and Event-Driven
- Gin
- RabbitMQ
- GRPC

We hope that you will also contribute to include all packages and frameworks to complete it.

## Lets Initial Knowledge
Currently we have built environmental bases as follows
